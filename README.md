#### Exercise 01
> Pacman that 'eats' as it moves from left to right (to do: add food)

#### Exercise 02: HTML/CSS Pambansang Watawat (Philippine Flag)
> Inspired by Hui Jing Chen's presentation, [Creating Art with CSS](https://www.chenhuijing.com/slides/64-connect-asia-2019/), during Connect Asia 2019. Big thanks to [Henry Lim](https://github.com/limhenry) and his project [Malaysian Flag using HTML and CSS](https://dev.to/henrylim96/how-to-create-malaysia-flag-with-html-and-css-3obe). (to do: recreate the stars and sun rays without SVG)

###### Will be adding more stuff later
